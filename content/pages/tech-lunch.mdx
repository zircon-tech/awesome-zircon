<p>
    The popular <b>Tech Lunch</b> is an important event for us. We have held this event practically since the beginning of Zircon. In fact, it is the only space where practically the entire company can share an hour of common interest and learning with other colleagues.
    <br />
    <br />
    Volunteers are always needed to take the lead in this meeting, so we invite you raise your hand and expose a topic of interest. I can be practically anything, it is not necessary to be an expert in the particular topic, simply with the willingness to present
    you will have already built a link towards general knowledge.
