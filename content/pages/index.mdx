#### About
<br />
<p>
Software development technology advances at a very fast pace, every day a new Framework, Library, Language to learn.
Fortunately, Zircon is also part of this growth by embracing new projects and experiences along the way. That's why we thought it necessary
start building our own resource pool to help us avoid to "reinvent the wheel", as they say, and enrich our public Github
with different things that have been resolved and validated in the different projects. The objective is to facilitate the support of strategies and resolution of problems when
someone should face a similar challenge in the future by streamlining the process and reusing the knowledge.

#### Usage
<br />
<p>
All content on this site is available to download and use anywhere. You can navigate the content by visiting the menu on the left as well as
clone any of the repository's submodules that will contain specific code examples. Also, the snippets in gist and links can be freely accessed.
</p>
<br />

#### Contribute
<br />

This is a space of all and for all. That is why it seems important to us that together we can collaborate with sources of information that help others. From a code snippet in gist,
a blog post, a boilerplate, a test with a library, a common use case such as "upload files", "implement an OAuth2 flow", a blockchain governance contract, etc.
Everything that is contained in this repository is publicly accessible, so it is an extra motivation to improve personal Github profiles by contributing to the repo.

There are 3 main ways to contribute: Either add an entry to this site, submit a PR with a link for a resource to the repo or add a repository to the main repository's list of git submodules.

1.  To add content to the site, add new pages by creating MDX files in the `content/pages` directory. `/content/pages/index.mdx` works as the main page.
    New pages are automatically added to the site navigation. To create sub-pages (represented in the navigation as collapsible lists),
    create a folder inside `content/pages` with the same name as the parent page you want to create a subpage for.
    The following example creates the page `foo.mdx` with the sub-page `bar.mdx`.

    ```text
    .
    â””â”€â”€ content
        â””â”€â”€ pages
            â”œâ”€â”€ foo
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bar.mdx
            â””â”€â”€ foo.mdx
    ```
<br />

2.  Another way to contribute is to add a tech link for a useful resource like an external post, a public repo, a Gist example or anything and submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch of this repository.

3.  The other way to add content is by using `git submodules`. To do this, it is simply necessary to link the existing repository to this using the command
    `git sumodule add <git repo>`. Then it will be important to update the existence of the repo in the documentation on this site both in the main README.md and on this site.
    To do this, simply find a suitable location to add the reference to or create a new submenu as mentioned in the previous step.

<br />

For code snippets, we prefer that you use [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). This allows us to maintain a database of snippets. You can add the reference to the index of this site.

Thanks for reading!
